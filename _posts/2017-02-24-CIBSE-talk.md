Last month Darren Robinson gave a talk as part of the event "Urban microclimate: overcoming obstacles to high density resilient cities" organised by [Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE)](http://www.cibse.org/). 

The slides of the talk entitled "On the simulation of energy use in buildings in their urban context..." are available as a part of the "Energy Management" session, via the Adaptation and Resilience in the Context of Change network (ARCC) website:
