title: An Adaptive Scaled Network for Public Transport Route Optimisation
---

We have a new article published in the journal [Public Transport](https://link.springer.com/journal/12469) entitled *An Adaptive Scaled Network for Public Transport Route Optimisation*. LUCAS researchers teamed up with colleagues from Cardiff University to tackle the challenge of automatic bus route optimisation. The first step was the creation of several bus route optimisation instances based on the city of Nottingham. We are making these datasets publicly available to enable other researchers to apply their own optimisation algorithm. Published alongside the instance data are our results as presented in the publication and a python program used to evaluate route sets.
