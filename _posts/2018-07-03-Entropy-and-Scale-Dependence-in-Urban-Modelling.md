title: Call for papers - Entropy and Scale-Dependence in Urban Modelling
---

Prof Darren Robinson and Dr Yong Mao are editing a Special Issue of the journal [Entropy](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy). The call title is ["Entropy and Scale-Dependence in Urban Modelling"](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/special_issues/Urban_Modelling) and is accepting submissions until 16th November 2018. 

>*Cities are complex systems that require resources to
function. They are maintained in more or less stable states
by exchanging entropy across their boundaries: Relatively
low entropy resources are imported, processed and higher
entropy wastes are exported. Entropy, as originally
developed by Boltzmann, measures all microscopic-scale
configurations of the universe, and in combination with the
second law of thermodynamics, provides a robust metric
for assessing universal irreversibility, and therefore future
sustainability.*

>*This Special Issue focuses on the application of entropy in
modelling and evaluating urbanisation at multiple scales.
The aim is to clarify the boundaries of applicability of
thermodynamic and information entropies, to
demonstrate their utility and to identify promising avenues
for future exploration.*
