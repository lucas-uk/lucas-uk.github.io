---

A summary of the [InSmart](http://www.insmartenergy.com/) project completed by [Gavin Long](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/departments/abe/people/gavin.long) and [Darren Robinson](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/environment-people-and-design/people/darren.robinson) has been published as a [GeoPlace](https://www.geoplace.co.uk) case study. The work describes the development of a virtual energy model of Nottingham's building stock, through integration of the Local Land and Property Gazetteer data found within [GeoPlace's AddressBase](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/addressbase-products.html) products.
