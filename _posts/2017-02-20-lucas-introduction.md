title: Hello urban world
---

We are a [group of researchers](https://nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/lucas/index.aspx) based at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/)  who are interested in understanding how cities develop and function, and how we can improve on their social, economic and environmental sustainability. 

Our interdisciplinary group emerged from the need to have a wide range of expertise in order to understand the complexity of urban environments. As such our backgrounds encompass the physical, computational, economic and social sciences.

In this blog we look forward to sharing our latest work on these topics.
