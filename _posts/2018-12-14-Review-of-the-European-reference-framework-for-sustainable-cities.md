---

[Amanda Winter](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/sociology/people/amanda.winter) has written a policy review for the International Journal of Community Well-Being. 

Abstract:
>*This review examines the European Reference Framework for Sustainable Cities, an online framework for use by urban practitioners to evaluate and visualize the sustainability profile and priorities of an urban sustainability plan, policy, or initiative. This review presents recognized benefits and challenges from a testing phase of the framework, how it fits into the European Urban Agenda, and more broadly how indicator frameworks connect to the global urban sustainability context.
